I joined LMU Munich in November 2023 as Assistant Professor at the 
Chair in Philosophy and Decision Theory, within the [MCMP](https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/).
During 2020 - 2023 I was a postdoc at the ILLC, University of Amsterdam, 
in the [COMSOC group](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/u.endriss/group.php) 
led by [Ulle Endriss](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/u.endriss/).
Prior to that I was a PhD student in the [DBAI group](https://www.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/) 
at TU Wien, supervised by [Stefan Woltran](https://www.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/staff/woltran/).

My interests lie in Social Choice, Belief Change and, more generally,
what it means for individuals and groups to be rational.
