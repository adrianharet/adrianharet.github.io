We will explore how game theory, the study of strategic decision-making, can be used to explain and predict human behavior across various contexts. Why are we sometimes willing to pay inordinate sums of money for a wrist-watch that tells the time as well as our phones? What explains feuds and long cycles of retaliation? And what is the best way to take a penalty shot? We will see how behaviors that seems puzzling, bizarre, or even irrational reflect some form of strategic thinking, when viewed through a game theory lens. By analyzing real-world scenarios, we will discover how concepts like Nash equilibrium, cooperation, and competition reveal the underlying logic of human choices.

## Week 2. Game Theory Basics
<div style="text-align: right">
    May 5, 2025
</div>

We dive into the basics of game theory. 
We start by defining what a game is, and then look at key notions: 
strategies (your game plan), payoffs (what you get out of it),
and equilibria (where everyoneâ€™s made their move and no one has a reason to change).

## Week 4. More Game Theory
<div style="text-align: right">

We get introduced to more ideas of game theory: evolutionary stability, and games in extensive form.

<!-- We're introduced to the Catalan thinker Ramon Llull.
Trying to find the most perfect way of electing an abbess, 
Llull put forward, around 800 years ago, not one, but two (!) voting rules.
The first is based on counting the number of wins each candidate gets 
in pairwise contests with the other candidates,
and is more commonly known today as [Copeland's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copeland%27s_method).
There is one technicality, which is the possibility of ties, but Llull hand-waived it away. 
Another problem was that this way of finding a winner took up more resources than were available at the time,
since it involved running an election for every possible pair of candidates. 
For 9 candidates, which was the number Llull was dealing with in his example, this amounts to 36 rounds of voting.

Llull tried to circumvent this problem by introducing a variant in which the 
loser in the first election was eliminated and the winner pitted against a new candidate, and so on, tournament style. 
This rule is known nowadays, unsurprisingly, as 
the tournament, or [round-robin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_voting) method of voting.
While faster (with 9 candidates it requires only rounds of voting), it is sensitive to the order in which candidates 
are lined up.
