We will explore how game theory, the study of strategic decision-making, can be used to explain and predict human behavior across various contexts. Why are we sometimes willing to pay inordinate sums of money for a wrist-watch that tells the time as well as our phones? What explains feuds and long cycles of retaliation? And what is the best way to take a penalty shot? We will see how behaviors that seems puzzling, bizarre, or even irrational reflect some form of strategic thinking, when viewed through a game theory lens. By analyzing real-world scenarios, we will discover how concepts like Nash equilibrium, cooperation, and competition reveal the underlying logic of human choices.

## Week 1. Intro and Our First Game
<div style="text-align: right">April 28, 2025 </div>

We kick things off by introducing ourselves, 
followed by a breakdown of the logistics of the course. 
And then we play our first game, where we try to guess what others are guessing.

## Week 2. The Trust Game and Games in Normal Form
<div style="text-align: right">May 5, 2025</div>

We start by playing the <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bestiary_of_Behavioral_Economics/Trust_Game">Trust Game</a>, 
and learn about how behavior in the game varies across the world.

We then dive into the basics of game theory. 
We start by defining what a game is, and then look at key notions: 
strategies (your game plan), payoffs (what you get out of it),
and Nash equilibria (where everyoneâ€™s made their move and no one has a reason to change).

## Week 4: Mixed Strategies
<div style="text-align: right">

Sometimes pure strategies are useless, and what you want to do is be unpredictable.
We learn about mixed strategies and see why John Nash got a Nobel prize.

- **About the video:** Lex Fridman talks to Tuomas Sandholm, who led a team that created an artificial agent for playing Texas Hold'em Poker. The link points to a specific moment where Sandholm discusses the Nash equilibrium and its crucial role in ensuring the success of the agent, though the entire interview is very interesting.
