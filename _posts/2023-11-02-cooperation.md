In a world of self-interested individuals, does cooperation makes sense?

and the mechanisms involved in its emergence and continued viability.

# Research Questions For the Final Assignment
1. Create a schematic model of the game theory of cancer. Discuss the assumptions behind it, and the consequences for
    the host organism. See [4, 6].
2. Discuss the game theory of specialization based on caste in eusocial insects (e.g., bees or ants). See [2].
