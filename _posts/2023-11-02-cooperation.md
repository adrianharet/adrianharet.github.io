In a world of self-interested individuals, does cooperation makes sense? 
The course will explore the phenomenon of cooperation: 
how it might arise under a set of precise, concrete assumptions about the individuals of a society, 
and the mechanisms involved in its emergence and continued viability.

# Research Questions For the Final Assignment
1. Create a schematic model of the game theory of cancer. Discuss the assumptions behind it, and the consequences for
    the host organism. See [4, 6].
2. Discuss the game theory of specialization based on caste in eusocial insects (e.g., bees or ants). See [2].
3. How does Tit-For-Tat work in a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma? Is it an equilibrium?
4. Reciprocity in the natural world. See, for instance, [1, 3].
5. How can we study altruism in people using economic games? And how do people perform in these games?
