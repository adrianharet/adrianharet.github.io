The course will offer a dive into the most prominent models for studying social behavior. 
As the saying goes, such models are wrong (i.e., simplifications of reality), but remarkably useful. 
We will study ways to model segregation, the spread of an idea, the dynamics of beliefs and opinions, 
the emergence of cooperation and coordination.

The course will mainly follow Paul Smaldinoâ€™s recent book Modeling Social Behavior, 
and will consist of weekly discussions around each chapter. 
The book doubles as a an introduction to agent-based modeling, 
but no coding experience is needed, or assumed, for the course. 
Our primary focus will be the models themselves and what they tell us about reality.


# Lectures

## Week 1 (October 15, 2024)
We start out by introducing ourselves, followed by a breakdown of the logistics of the course.
Details are found on the slides, [here](/content/teaching/2024-2025-model-agents/00-logistics.pdf).

We followed with a discussion on models in science, and a glimpse of the Netlogo modeling language.
Slides are [here](/content/teaching/2024-2025-model-agents/01-why-model.pdf).

## Week 2 (October 22, 2024)
We will be discussing Chapter 1 of Smaldino's book.
