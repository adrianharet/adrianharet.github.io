Our image of democratic procedures centers on electing representatives (presidents, mayors, parties) 
at regular intervals, years apart. 
But collective decisions are far more ubiquitous and, with the advent of modern technology, 
far more frequent than the typical image suggests. 
The ideas behind the election of representatives are being tweaked and reworked to decide 
the allocation of a broad range of resources, 
from seats in parliaments, to budgets of municipalities, to places in high schools and kidneys. 

The methods used are sometimes carefully planned, sometimes ad-hoc, but they always challenge us to reflect on what we expect and value in a collective decision procedure. 
How do we ensure fairness? How do we achieve accuracy? And, is there a tension between the two?
The course will survey methods of democratic decision making that go beyond standard models of voting. 
The students will be invited to identify values embedded in concrete procedures (e.g., in the Deferred Acceptance method), 
to reflect on them (e.g., in what sense is the method fair), to find weaknesses, blind-spots and limitations.

# Possible Questions For the Final Assignment
Any of the themes covered in the the course (voting, apportionment, wisdom of crowds/epistemic democracy, participatory budgeting) is appropriate as a research topic.
The list of works in the Bibliography sections are general overviews of these fields, but going deeper into one aspect is welcome, and encouraged.
The material covered so far can also serve as inspiration for research into a new type of question: in principle, any type of problem that involves adjudicating 
between diverse, possibly conflicting, points of view, is fair game. Some examples that come to mind:

1. How should we aggregate ratings for products on online shopping platforms? For instance, ratings may come in the form of stars (1 to 5) from different sources across the web. 
It is tempting to say we will take the average, but maybe the number of ratings should also play a role? Should an average rating of 4.5 out of five reviews count as better than 
an average of 4.2 out of 1000 reviews? What other methods can we come up with? What is the right way of thinking about this problem? What can go wrong with the average? 
What properties (axioms) should a rating system satisfy?
