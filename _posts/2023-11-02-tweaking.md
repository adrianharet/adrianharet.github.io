Our image of democratic procedures centers on electing representatives (presidents, mayors, parties) 
at regular intervals, years apart. 
But collective decisions are far more ubiquitous and, with the advent of modern technology, 
far more frequent than the typical image suggests. 
The ideas behind the election of representatives are being tweaked and reworked to decide 
the allocation of a broad range of resources, 
from seats in parliaments, to budgets of municipalities, to places in high schools and kidneys. 

The methods used are sometimes carefully planned, sometimes ad-hoc, but they always challenge us to reflect on what we expect and value in a collective decision procedure. 
How do we ensure fairness? How do we achieve accuracy? And, is there a tension between the two?
The course will survey methods of democratic decision making that go beyond standard models of voting. 
The students will be invited to identify values embedded in concrete procedures (e.g., in the Deferred Acceptance method), 
to reflect on them (e.g., in what sense is the method fair), to find weaknesses, blind-spots and limitations.
