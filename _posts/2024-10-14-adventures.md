Though often taken for granted, democratic institutions have been subject to change and tinkering since their early days. 
The aim of the course is to look under the bonnet of voting systems, juries and apportionment rules, 
and see how the rules of the game have been questioned and refined over time. 
We will focus on a series of notable moments in democratic decision making, 
starting in Ancient Greece and ending with present day efforts to find a perfectly proportional representation system. 
The course will mainly follow George Szpiro’s *Numbers Rule. The Vexing Mathematics of Democracy, from Plato to the Present*, 
and structured as a series of weekly discussions on each chapter in the book. 
There will also be additional material on recent developments and trends.

        Epistemic vs non-epistemic voting
    </a>
</div>

We start out by introducing ourselves, followed by a breakdown of the logistics of the course. 
We then have our first glimpse of social choice theory,
and two ways of thinking about voting: 
as a procedure for finding society's opinion about an unknown ground truth (epistemic voting), 
versus as a procedure for aggregating preferences into an expression of what 
voters want (non-epistemic voting).



## Week 2 (October 21, 2024)
We look at an early example of a functioning democracy: Ancient Athens.
We see how Athenian democracy worked, and hear from one of its main critics, 
local thinker and would-be advisor to kings called Plato.

The readings are Chapter 3 of Lane (2014), for an overview of democratic Athens, 
and Chapter 1 from Szpiro (2010) for Plato's alternative.
As a bonus reading, also have a look at Chapter 4 of Melissa Lane's book.

Adrian's slides for how Athenian democracy functioned are

Nestor's slides for Plato's alternative, based on Szpiro's book, are 
[here](/content/teaching/2024-ws-adventures/02-02-nestor-antidemocrat.pdf).


## Week 3 (October 28, 2024)
We start getting into the weeds of voting, with an early example of trying 
to manipulate a collective decision: the trial of Afranius Dexter's purported killers, 
as reported by Pliny the Younger. 
The reading is Chapter 2 of Szpiro (2010), and Victoria will be leading the discussion.

The takeaway from this week is that the rule used to determine the outcome of such a collective decision
(plurality, or First-Past-the-Post) encourages tactical voting. Why? Because the outcome using this rule
often mis-represents the preferences of the voters. There is a real possibility that the winner is hated
by most of the voters, and the the upshot is that voters will be strategic about how they place their votes.

This is a broad phenomenon that afflicts many modern elections, not just trials in the Ancient world.

## Week 4 (November 4, 2024)
We read Chapter 3 of Szpiro (2010), which introduces us to the Catalan thinker Ramon Llull.
Trying to find the most perfect way of electing an abbess, Llull put forward, around 800 years ago, 
not one, but two (!) voting rules.
The first is based on counting the number of wins each candidate gets in pairwise contests with the other candidates,
and is more commonly known today as [Copeland's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copeland%27s_method).
Apart from the technicality of ties, which Llull hand-waived away, this problem takes up a lot of time and resources:
we need to run an election for every possible pair of candidates. 
For 9 candidates, which was the number Llull was dealing with in his example, this amounts to 36 rounds of voting.

Lull tries to circumvent this problem by introducing a variant in which the 
loser in the first election is eliminated, while the winner is pitted against a new candidate, and so on, tournament style. 
This rule is known nowadays, unsurprisingly, as 
the tournament, or [round-robin method of voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_voting).
While faster (with 9 candidates it requires only rounds of voting), it is sensitive to the order in which candidates 
are lined up.

## Week 5 (November 11, 2024)
We are reading Chapter 4 of Szpiro (2010). 
We find out about Nicolaus Cusanus and his quest to find the best way to elect a pope.
Cusanus' idea involves ranking candidates, and assigning them points.
The winner is the candidate with the most overall points, an idea that will be rediscovered 
by Borda some years later (and which we will look at next week).

We see that there are many ways to assign points,
learn about the general idea of scoring rules, 
and see some concrete examples (e.g., Eurovision, or Formula 1).

Lena is presenting.

## Week 6 (November 18, 2024)
We learn about Borda rule. The reading is Chapter 5 of Szpiro (2010).
We see that, even though intuitively appealing, Borda has several drawbacks:
it can select mediocre candidates, candidates whom a majority of the voters think 
are worse than some other candidate, and it is embarrassingly easy to manipulate.

Federico is presenting. His slides are

Adrian's slides are 
[here](/content/teaching/2024-ws-adventures/06-02-borda-rule.pdf).

## Week 7 (November 25, 2024)
We formalize the idea that candidates deserving to win an election should 
be those candidates that win in head-to-head contests against other candidates,
an idea credited to Condorcet.
Condorcet winners are nice, but they have the disadvantage of not always existing.
The reading is Szpiro (2010), Chapter 6.

Adrian's slides are 
[here](/content/teaching/2024-ws-adventures/07-01-condorcet-consistency.pdf).


## Week 8 (December 2, 2024)
Our quest for the perfect rule continues.
We meet two new voting rules: approval voting and range voting.
Both are based on the idea of distributing points liberally to preferred candidates. 

We see that, despite being intuitively appealing and very permissive, range voting 
can degenerate into a simpler manifestation by voters assigning extreme points 
in an attempt to manipulate the result.
Meanwhile, approval voting seems to be specialists' favorite rule, with plurality 
as the least favorite
(see Laslier (2012) for the result of a poll conducted among social choice theorists). 
 
The reading is Chapter 5 of Volić (2024).
Victoria is presenting.
Her slides are [here](/content/teaching/2024-ws-adventures/08-01-victoria-approval-range-voting.pdf).


## Week 9 (December 9, 2024)
The lecture is about Instant-Runoff Voting, also known as Single Transferable Vote,
Ranked-Choice Voting, or, in the UK, Alternative Vote.
We hear about the good, the bad and the ugly aspects of trying to actually make it work in real life.

The presentation is mainly based on Chapter 3 of Volić (2024).
Adrian's slides are
[here](/content/teaching/2024-ws-adventures/09-01-stv.pdf).


## Week 10 (December 16, 2024)
This week we find out, finally, why democracy is impossible.

We will see Arrow's theorem, together with the (non-trivial) proof.
Nestor is presenting.

## Week 11 (December 23, 2024)
Christmas break. No lecture today.
