Our opinions are often formed, and changed, in response to the opinions of our peers. Discussion, deliberation, or imitation can be just as important as silent reflection in shaping what we believe. But can we trust such processes, when compounded across the whole of society, to deliver more accurate beliefs, or do they steer us away from the truth?

The course will focus on the interplay between opinion dynamics and the wisdom of crowds. We will look at the crucial, and sometimes overlooked, role of social networks in the way beliefs are formed and spread in a group. We will want to understand how consensus and polarization can arise in a network of agents, and under what conditions we can expect to see wisdom of the crowds.

The coursework will consist of weekly discussions based on the core texts cited in the bibliography. We will study both case-studies and formal models. For the latter, a prerequisite is some basic knowledge of algebra and probability theory.

We kick things off by introducing ourselves, 
followed by a breakdown of the logistics of the course. 
And then we play a guessing game!

## Week 2. Game Theory Basics
<div style="text-align: right">
    May 5, 2025
</div>

We dive into the basics of game theory. 
We start by defining what a game is, and then look at key notions: 
strategies (your game plan), payoffs (what you get out of it), \
and equilibria (where everyoneâ€™s made their move and no one has a reason to change).

## Week 4. More Game Theory
<div style="text-align: right">

We get introduced to more ideas of game theory: evolutionary stability, and games in extensive form.

<!-- We're introduced to the Catalan thinker Ramon Llull.
Trying to find the most perfect way of electing an abbess, 
Llull put forward, around 800 years ago, not one, but two (!) voting rules.
The first is based on counting the number of wins each candidate gets 
in pairwise contests with the other candidates,
and is more commonly known today as [Copeland's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copeland%27s_method).
There is one technicality, which is the possibility of ties, but Llull hand-waived it away. 
Another problem was that this way of finding a winner took up more resources than were available at the time,
since it involved running an election for every possible pair of candidates. 
For 9 candidates, which was the number Llull was dealing with in his example, this amounts to 36 rounds of voting.

Llull tried to circumvent this problem by introducing a variant in which the 
loser in the first election was eliminated and the winner pitted against a new candidate, and so on, tournament style. 
This rule is known nowadays, unsurprisingly, as 
the tournament, or [round-robin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_voting) method of voting.
While faster (with 9 candidates it requires only rounds of voting), it is sensitive to the order in which candidates 
are lined up.
