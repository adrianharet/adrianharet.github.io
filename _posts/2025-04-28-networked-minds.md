Our opinions are often formed, and changed, in response to the opinions of our peers. Discussion, deliberation, or imitation can be just as important as silent reflection in shaping what we believe. But can we trust such processes, when compounded across the whole of society, to deliver more accurate beliefs, or do they steer us away from the truth?

The course will focus on the interplay between opinion dynamics and the wisdom of crowds. We will look at the crucial, and sometimes overlooked, role of social networks in the way beliefs are formed and spread in a group. We will want to understand how consensus and polarization can arise in a network of agents, and under what conditions we can expect to see wisdom of the crowds.

The coursework will consist of weekly discussions based on the core texts cited in the bibliography. We will study both case-studies and formal models. For the latter, a prerequisite is some basic knowledge of algebra and probability theory.
