Our opinions are often formed, and changed, in response to the opinions of our peers. Discussion, deliberation, or imitation can be just as important as silent reflection in shaping what we believe. But can we trust such processes, when compounded across the whole of society, to deliver more accurate beliefs, or do they steer us away from the truth?

The course will focus on the interplay between opinion dynamics and the wisdom of crowds. We will look at the crucial, and sometimes overlooked, role of social networks in the way beliefs are formed and spread in a group. We will want to understand how consensus and polarization can arise in a network of agents, and under what conditions we can expect to see wisdom of the crowds.

The coursework will consist of weekly discussions based on the core texts cited in the bibliography. We will study both case-studies and formal models. For the latter, a prerequisite is some basic knowledge of algebra and probability theory.

## Week 1. Intro
<div style="text-align: right">
    April 28, 2025
</div>

We kick things off by introducing ourselves, 
followed by a breakdown of the logistics of the course. 
We then get a first glimpse of the wisdom of crowds in a guessing game,
and hear about the wisdom of the stock market and epistemic democracy.

## Week 2. The Condorcet Jury Theorem...
<div style="text-align: right">
    May 5, 2025
</div>

We see the Condorcet Jury Theorem, the landmark result of the wisdom of crowds.  
We learn about what the theorem says, and see the proof.

## Week 3. ... and Beyond
<div style="text-align: right">

We see whether the insights of the Condorcet Jury Theorem survive when we relax some of the basic assumptions.

## Week 4. The Optimal Voting Rule & Trade Routes in the Middle Ages

<div style="text-align: right">
    May 19, 2025
</div>

We learn about the optimal voting rule when competences are known: a weighted voting rule
that assigns weights proportional to competences.

And then we segue into social networks, by seeing an example with trade routes in the Middle Ages.

## Week 6. Reasoning About Social Networks
<div style="text-align: right">

</div>

We start with a puzzle: how did the Medici become so important in 15th century Florence, 
especially when Cosimo de Medici, the leader of the family, was not a particularly leader?
The answer, it has been argued, has something to do with networks.
Along the way, we learn how to represent social networks and see some important statistics.

## Week 8. Centrality Measures
<div style="text-align: right">
    June 16, 2025
</div>

We see three ways to measure the centrality of a node in a social network: 
degree centrality, betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality. 
And we finally find out why the Medici were crucial in the network of elite 15th century Florentine families.

## Week 10. The DeGroot Model and Naive Wisdom
<div style="text-align: right">
    June 30, 2025
</div>

We learn about the DeGroot model, an influential model of opinion dynamics, 
and we study the conditions under which the group can converge to a true opinion.
