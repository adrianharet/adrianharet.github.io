Though often taken for granted, democratic institutions have been subject to change and tinkering since their early days. The aim of the course is to look under the bonnet of voting systems, juries and apportionment rules, and see how the rules of the game have been questioned and refined over time. We will focus on a series of notable moments in democratic decision making, starting in Ancient Greece and ending with present day efforts to find a perfectly proportional representation system. The course will mainly follow George Szpiroâ€™s *Numbers Rule. The Vexing Mathematics of Democracy, from Plato to the Present*, and structured as a series of weekly discussions on each chapter in the book. There will also be additional material on recent developments and trends.
