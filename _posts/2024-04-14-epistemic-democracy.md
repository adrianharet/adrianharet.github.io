We will explore the idea that democracies tend to produce good decisions, also known as epistemic democracy. 
According to this view, the value of democratic decision procedures lies not only in the fact that they are fair, 
but also in the fact that they can be good at approximating the truth, when there is a truth to be discovered.
We will explore the mechanisms that make democracies efficient in this sense: laws of large numbers, diversity, deliberation. 
In doing so we will touch on celebrated results such as the Condorcet Jury Theorem, and get glimpse of ways in which things 
can go wrong through misinformation, polarization or the systematic suppression of certain voices.


# Lectures
## Week 1 (April 15, 2024)
We started by introducing ourselves, followed by a breakdown of the logistics of the course. 
[[pdf](/content/teaching/2024-epistemic-democracy/00-logistics.pdf)]

This was followed by a lecture on the general idea of the wisdom of crowds.
[[pdf](/content/teaching/2024-epistemic-democracy/01-wisdom-of-crowds.pdf)]

## Week 2 (April 22, 2024)
A lecture on the Condorcet Jury theorem, the cornerstone result for the wisdom of crowds.
[[pdf](/content/teaching/2024-epistemic-democracy/02-cjt.pdf)]

## Week 3 (April 29, 2024)
A lecture on what happens to the conclusions of the Condorcet Jury Theorem when its assumptions are relaxed.
[[pdf](/content/teaching/2024-epistemic-democracy/03-beyond-cjt.pdf)]
